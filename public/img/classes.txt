Private: accessible only in the class
protected: accessible in the class and the classes that inherate the class 
readonly: you cant change its value after it is assigned
static: you can't call a variable inside the class by this when it is static // you can access it by the 
name of the class
abstract: if you have a method that it is abstract, your class should be abstract too // an abstract 
method should be overrieded in the classes that inheritate from the class
abstract class: A class that can't be instantiated but has to be extended
singletons: you can only instantiate the class for once // you can do that by making the constructor private

you can inherate from only one class
you can implement many interfaces
